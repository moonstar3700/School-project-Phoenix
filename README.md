# Phoenix Framework Web Application

This project is a web application developed using the Phoenix framework in Elixir. The main focus of this application was to demonstrate adaptability to new technology by creating a web app in Phoenix with minimal guidance.

## Project Overview

The Phoenix framework is built on Elixir and uses the Erlang VM (BEAM). It is known for its performance, reliability, and scalability, making it suitable for building real-time web applications.

## Setup and Configuration

To set up and run the Phoenix framework web application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Elixir and Phoenix:**
   - Ensure that Elixir and Phoenix are installed on your system. You can install them using:
     ```bash
     mix archive.install hex phx_new
     ```

2. **Create a New Phoenix Project:**
   - Open a terminal and run the following command to generate a new Phoenix project:
     ```bash
     mix phx.new my_app
     ```
   - Replace `my_app` with your preferred project name.

3. **Navigate to the Project:**
   - Change directory to your project folder:
     ```bash
     cd my_app
     ```

### Database Setup

1. **Configure Database:**
   - Open `config/dev.exs` and update the database configuration under the `config :my_app, MyApp.Repo` section.

2. **Create and Migrate Database:**
   - Create the database and run migrations using:
     ```bash
     mix ecto.create
     mix ecto.migrate
     ```

3. **Seed the Database (Optional):**
   - If needed, seed the database with initial data:
     ```bash
     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Phoenix Server:**
   - Start the Phoenix server by running:
     ```bash
     mix phx.server
     ```

2. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to view your Phoenix web application.

## Example

Suppose you created a Phoenix project named `my_app`. After setting up, migrating the database, and starting the server:

- You can access your web application at `http://localhost:4000`.
- Customize and build your Phoenix web application according to your project requirements.

## Notes

- Make sure to have Elixir and Phoenix installed and configured properly.
- Adjust configurations and file paths based on your project structure and requirements.
